    <h1 class="mb-4">How It Works</h1>
    <p>
        At <strong>Awda</strong>, our goal is to simplify the process of reuniting lost individuals with their families. Here's how our platform works to ensure 
        a seamless and effective experience for users.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Step 1: Upload Information</h2>
    <p>
        When someone goes missing, the first step is to provide the necessary information about the individual. This includes their name, age, physical description, 
        and any identifying features. Additionally, you can upload a recent photo of the missing person to help others identify them easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        This information will be saved in our database and made accessible for searches by you and other users of the platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Step 2: Search for Matches</h2>
    <p>
        Once the information is uploaded, you can take one of two approaches to search for the missing individual:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Browse the Dashboard:</strong> View the collection of photos and details of people who have been found. This allows you to manually look through the database for a potential match.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use the AI-Powered Find Feature:</strong> Our advanced AI algorithm analyzes the uploaded photo and compares it with the database of found individuals to determine the closest matches. This helps you quickly locate the person you are searching for with minimal effort.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Step 3: Confirm the Match</h2>
    <p>
        If a match is found using the AI feature or through manual browsing, you will be provided with the contact information of the person who found the individual. This ensures a direct line of communication to verify details and arrange for a reunion.
