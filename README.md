**Awda Project**  
A web-based platform designed to assist in locating missing and found individuals.

## Features

1. **QR Code Bracelet**:
    
    - A bracelet equipped with a QR code to help identify and guide individuals who are lost and unable to communicate their location.
2. **AI-Powered Location Suggestions**:
    
    - Provides intelligent location suggestions to aid those searching for missing individuals, utilizing data analysis and artificial intelligence.

## Proposal

The Awda application focuses on helping during critical momentsâ€”when someone is lost or searching for a missing individual. However, an additional feature could enhance its utility:

- **Proactive Tracking**:
    - By integrating hardware into the bracelet and connecting it to a phone, users could receive alerts when the tracked individual moves out of range. This feature uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to trigger alarms if proximity boundaries are breached.
    - Due to time constraints, this feature is currently not implemented but holds potential for future development.
